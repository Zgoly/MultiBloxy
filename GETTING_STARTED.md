## Run 🚀
MultiBloxy is portable, so you can run it right away. However, it's a good idea to add it to the `StartUp` folder so that Windows automatically opens it when you start your PC.

To do that, follow these steps:
1. **Open the Run Dialog**:
   - Press the <kbd>Win</kbd> key (the Windows key) and the <kbd>R</kbd> key simultaneously. This will open the Run dialog box.

2. **Navigate to the Startup Folder**:
   - In the Run dialog box, paste the following path: `%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp`.
   - Click on `OK` to open the Startup folder.

3. **Add MultiBloxy to the Startup Folder**:
   - Locate the `MultiBloxy.exe` file that you have downloaded.
   - Drag and drop the `MultiBloxy.exe` file into the Startup folder that you opened in the previous step.

4. **Launch MultiBloxy**:
   - You can now launch MultiBloxy by double-clicking the `MultiBloxy.exe` file in the Startup folder.
   - Alternatively, you can restart your PC to ensure that MultiBloxy starts automatically the next time you log in.

By following these steps, you will ensure that MultiBloxy is set to run automatically whenever you start your computer.

## ⚠️ Fixing Error 773 in Multi-Account Roblox Sessions

Error 773 typically occurs when using multiple Roblox app instances due to session conflicts during login. To apply the fix below, you’ll first need to know how to create additional Roblox instances.

### 🔄 How to Open a New Roblox Instance

You can launch a new Roblox instance in either of the following ways:

- **Using the Roblox App**:  
  1. Right-click on the Roblox app icon in the **taskbar**.  
  2. Select **`Roblox Game Client`** from the context menu.

- **Using MultiBloxy**:  
  1. Go to the **[system tray](https://learn.microsoft.com/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/s/system-tray )** (located in the bottom-right corner of your screen).  
  2. Right-click on the **`MultiBloxy`** icon.  
  3. Choose **`Start New Roblox Instance`** from the menu.

> 💡 Tip: Repeat this process to open as many instances as you have accounts.

### Step-by-Step Fix:

1. **Create All Desired Roblox Instances**:  
   Open as many Roblox app instances as the number of accounts you intend to use (e.g., 3 accounts → 3 instances).

2. **Log In to Each Account**:  
   In each instance, manually log in to the respective Roblox account.

3. **Immediately Log Out from All Instances**:  
   Before doing anything else (e.g., launching a game), go back to the Roblox app home screen in **every instance** and **log out** of all accounts.

4. **Re-Log In with Intended Mapping**:  
   - In the **first** instance, log back in with your **first** account.  
   - In the **second** instance, log in with your **second** account.  
   - Continue this pattern for all instances and accounts.

5. **Avoid Mid-Session Account Switching**:  
   Do **not** use the Roblox app’s built-in account switcher after this setup - it can reintroduce the conflict.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you make a mistake during this process (e.g., launch a game before reassigning accounts correctly), **restart your computer** to clear lingering sessions and reduce the risk of error recurrence.

This workaround ensures each Roblox instance maintains a clean, isolated login session - effectively bypassing the root cause of error 773.
