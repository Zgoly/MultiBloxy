# Getting Started with MultiBloxy 🎮🔓

## Download ⬇️
[Download MultiBloxy.exe (direct link) 🔗](https://github.com/Zgoly/MultiBloxy/releases/latest/download/MultiBloxy.exe)

## Run 🚀
MultiBloxy is portable, so you can run it right away. However, it's a good idea to add it to the `StartUp` folder so that Windows automatically opens it when you start your PC.

To do that, follow these steps:
1. Press <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> to open the Run dialog.
2. Paste this path: `%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp`
3. Drag and drop the downloaded `MultiBloxy.exe` file into this folder.
4. Launch MultiBloxy (or restart your PC).
